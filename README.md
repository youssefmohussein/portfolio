# Hey 👋 What's up?

I'm **Youssef Mohamed**, a sophomore CS student from Egypt 🇪🇬  
I love turning coffee ☕ into code and building cool stuff that *sometimes* works on the first try 😅

## 👨‍💻 A little about me

- 🧠 I'm studying Computer Science at Misr International University (Class of 2027)
- 🧩 I enjoy solving problems with C++, Java, and JavaScript
- 🛠️ I build full-stack web apps, GUIs, and even full network systems
- 💻 I'm currently learning more about cybersecurity and clean architecture
- 🌱 Always curious, always building

## 🚀 What I’ve Built

✨ **E-Commerce Jewelry Store**  
Full-stack online store with user auth, shopping cart, and admin dashboard — built with MongoDB, Express, Node.js, and lots of CSS polish.

📚 **Library Management System**  
Desktop app built in JavaFX with book/member management, OOP concepts, and GUI design.

🏦 **Bank Management System**  
C++ console project for deposits, withdrawals, and account handling — structured and secure.

🧠 **Word Frequency Analyzer**  
Built with Red-Black Trees in C++ and a Qt-based GUI. Reads and analyzes text files fast and efficiently.

🕸️ **Network Design Project**  
Used Cisco Packet Tracer to create a full network: VLANs, OSPF, VPN, DHCP, NAT, and Wi-Fi. Fully documented and 100% connected.

🔐 **Password & Plate Checker**  
Two mini-systems: one uses Dynamic Programming, the other a Greedy Algorithm. Clean logic, strong validation.
